TRAINING_PROMPT = """Here is the text that contains private information.
{input}

Your task is to find all private information in the text and rewrite it, enclosing each individual private detail in <PRIVATE> and </PRIVATE> tags.
Tag each atomic private fact separately â€” even if multiple facts appear in the same sentence.

Example:
Input:
Quintin, a 40-year-old logistician from Converse, TX, balances curiosity with practicality, appreciating both new ideas and established methods, and maintains a unique blend of organization and flexibility in all aspects of life.
Output:
<PRIVATE>Quintin</PRIVATE>, <PRIVATE>a 40-year-old</PRIVATE> <PRIVATE>logistician</PRIVATE> from <PRIVATE>Converse, TX</PRIVATE>, balances curiosity with practicality, appreciating both new ideas and established methods, and maintains a unique blend of organization and flexibility in all aspects of life.   

Result:
